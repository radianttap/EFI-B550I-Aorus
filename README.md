## Current hardware

- [Gigabyte B550I Aorus Pro AX](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B550I-AORUS-PRO-AX-rev-10/) motherboard (rev 1.0)
- AMD [Ryzen 9 5900X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-5900x) CPU
- AMD [RX 6900 XT](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt) graphics card, no riser card.
- Corsair [Vengeance LPX](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Memory/VENGEANCE-LPX/p/CMK32GX4M2D3600C18) 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4 3600MHz CL18
- WD [Black SN850X](https://www.westerndigital.com/en-il/products/internal-drives/wd-black-sn850x-nvme-ssd#WDS200T2X0E) 2TB NVMe SSD
- WD [Black SN770](https://www.westerndigital.com/en-il/products/internal-drives/wd-black-sn770-nvme-ssd#WDS100T3X0E) 1TB NVMe SSD
- [Broadcom BCM94360NG](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003324812245.html) card, direct replacement for the existing card on the board.

Note: it‚Äôs fairly easy to switch between Ryzen 5000 CPUs, just carefully update the `Replace` value in first 4 `Kernel/Patch` entries, as [per AMD OSX Vanilla repo](https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla).

You can use any of these cards: Radeon 6600 XT, 6800, 6800 XT, 6900 XT ‚Äî all are natively supported.

### BIOS

Version `F18c`

- Fast Boot: `Disabled`
- CSM: `Disabled`
- Above 4G Decoding: `Enabled`
- Resizable Bar Support: `Enabled`
- PCIe slot speed: `Auto`
- XMP Profile activated

## Usage

1. [Update `PlatformInfo/Generic` stuff](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) with your own, inside `config.plist`
2. Use your Ethernet‚Äôs MAC address for `ROM` value, as explained in the Dortania guide. Don‚Äôt leave it as all 0s.
3. There are two USB maps - one without any onboard USB headers connected (no chassis ports) and one with all headers connected giving additional 2 USB-A 3.0 ports and 2 USB-A 2.0 ports. The former one is enabled in _config.plist_

## Status

Almost *everything* works, except the usual AMD caveats.

## Notes

- OpenCanopy (GUI boot menu) is up and running.
- I don‚Äôt boot Windows 10/11 using OC, thus I can‚Äôt guarantee it will work. I have Windows installed on separate SSD and switch using Boot Menu.

*Use at your own risk.* Nothing is guaranteed, even if you use exactly the same hardware as me.

You may use this EFI as example but be prepared to dive way deeper than you hoped. It‚Äôs always advisable to build your own EFI from scratch, [following the guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) ‚Äî  then you‚Äôll have an idea how things work,  how to ask for help in proper channels:
- [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/)
- [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Wxam8aH)
- AMD-OSX [forums](https://forum.amd-osx.com)

Most importantly ‚Äî doing stuff step by step will give you knowledge how to act on given help and hints.

Good luck.
